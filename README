What Kind of Phone Do You Use? 
By: Sarah Schaffel, Hallie Varto, Sam Oleari, Casey Debaise and Leo Yan

In this project we crawled twitter using different key words to gather tweets. 
We wanted to determine if there were indicators of what phone you use (iPhone
or Android) based on the words in the tweets. We used naive bayes to determine
if we were able to correctly identify which tweets were made by which device.
We used another program to determine precision and recall to better evaulate 
our system.  

The tweets folder contains all the tweets we got from the query with the key word 
that is the title of each document.
The sorted tweets folder are singular tweets in each file where the source was specified 
as android or iphone, and they are labeled as such.
